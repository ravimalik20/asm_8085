Exploring the realms of microprocessors

'Running code on bare metal is fun'
	- Linus Torvalds

To learn something new, one effective approach is to learn by doing.
Hence in my journey of learning by doing, the following repository is
a collection of the 8085 assembly language programs which will help understand the 8085 microprocessor.

All the source code is written in GNUSim8085 and due to this the code
might slightly differ from the actual assembly code for the 8085.

Hope it would be helpful to someone as it is for me.

Cheers!!
