Exploring the realms of microprocessors

'Running code on bare metal is fun'
	- Linus Torvalds

To learn something new, one effective approach is to learn by doing.
Hence in my journey of learning by doing, the following repository is
a collection of the 8085 assembly language programs which will help understand the 8085 microprocessor.

Hope it would be helpful to someone as it is for me.

Cheers!!
